                Smart Education, Smart e-Learning, Smart Universities and Smart Pedagogy are emerging and rapidly growing areas. They have a potential to transform existing teaching strategies, learning environments, educational activities, and supporting technology in a classroom. They are focused at enabling instructors to develop new ways of achieving excellence in teaching in technological smart classrooms and smart universities, and providing students with new opportunities to maximize their success and select the best options for their education, location, learning style, and mode of learning content delivery.
            </p>
            
            <p>    
                The 9th international conference on Smart Education and e-Learning (SEEL) will be held on June 20-22, 2022 at the Rhodes Island, Greece at the Sheraton Hotel and Resort. It will host the 2022 International Forum of Ph.D. Students who are involved in conference-related doctoral studies and research (2022 Ph.D. Student Forum). It is a major international forum for Ph.D. students to present innovative ideas, approaches, concepts, technologies, systems, preliminary or final findings and outcomes of research activities and Ph.D. studies in the emerging areas of smart education, smart e-learning, smart pedagogy, smart analytics, applications of smart technology and smart systems in education and e-learning, smart classrooms, smart universities, and knowledge-based smart society.
